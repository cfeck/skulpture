*** About Skulpture ***

Skulpture is a GUI style addon for KDE programs.  It features a classical
three-dimensional artwork with shadows and smooth gradients to enhance the
visual experience.

Skulpture has been designed to be light and easy on eyes; many distracting
borders or graphical elements have been removed or replaced by simpler
artwork.

You can set Skulpture as the KDE default style with the "System Settings"
program.  Skulpture includes a style for applications, color schemes, and a
theme for the KDE window manager.  For a matching Plasma style, install the
Atelier theme.

Skulpture can also be used with Qt programs.  To do so, use the command line
option "-style Skulpture" when invoking the Qt program.  Additionally, you
can set this style as the Qt default style with the "qtconfig" program.
