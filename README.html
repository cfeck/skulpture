<h3>About Skulpture</h3>
<p>
Skulpture is a GUI style addon for <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> programs.  It features a classical
three-dimensional artwork with shadows and smooth gradients to enhance the
visual experience.
</p><p>
Skulpture has been designed to be light and easy on eyes; many distracting
borders or graphical elements have been removed or replaced by simpler
artwork.
</p><p>
You can set Skulpture as the KDE default style with the "System Settings"
program.  Skulpture includes a style for applications, color schemes, and a
theme for the KDE window manager.  For a matching Plasma style, install the
<a href="http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php/?content=99440">Atelier</a> theme.
</p><p>
Skulpture can also be used with <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a> programs.  To do so, use the command line
option "-style Skulpture" when invoking the Qt program.  Additionally, you
can set this style as the Qt default style with the "qtconfig" program.
