=== Installing Skulpture ===

*** Installation ***

Installation from source requires CMake.  To install, type the following at
the shell prompt within the "skulpture-0.2.4" directory, including the
dot.  Note that you are prompted for the root password during installation.

	sh install.sh

You should restart the system after installation, so that KWin sees the
freshly installed style.


*** Deinstallation ***

To uninstall, type the following at the shell prompt within the directory
from which you installed.  If you deleted that directory, just install it
again.  Again, you are prompted for the root password.

	sh uninstall.sh
